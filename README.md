## Development

cancancan-mongoid uses [appraisals](https://github.com/thoughtbot/appraisal) to test the code base against multiple versions 
of Mongoid

When first developing, you may need to run `bundle install` and then `appraisal install`, to install the different sets.

You can then run all appraisal files (like CI does), with `appraisal rake` or just run a specific set `appraisal mongoid_6.1 rake`.
